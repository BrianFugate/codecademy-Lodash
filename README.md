# codecademy-Lodash

This JS code is for a Codecademy project in the Full-Stack Engineer career path. The project is an optional project at the end of the JavaScript Syntax, Part II portion of the Building Interactive Websites section of the course curriculum. The Codecademy project description is below.

Lodash
In this project, you will be recreating some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular lodash.js library which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.

Implementing the methods from lodash on your own is an invaluable exercise in problem-solving and a great way to understand how the methods work! We’ve selected ten methods for you to implement and, in implementing each method, you will follow these four steps:

1. Specify the functionality of the method we are implementing
2. Ideate a game plan for how to implement this functionality in code
3. Implement our game plan
4. Test our code to ensure it works as expected
   
We encourage you to try to complete the “Ideate” and “Implement” steps on your own before consulting our suggestions for each. It may be difficult at points, but working through difficult problems on your own will be incredibly helpful in your journey to become a stronger developer. Once you’ve come up with a solution on your own, or if you have become so stuck you are no longer being productive, check out our steps to see our suggestions for how to solve the problem.

There are many approaches we can take to solve a problem in programming. As a result, don’t be frustrated if the solution we present is different than the solution you came up with. We are merely trying to challenge you to consider many different solutions. Your solution is equally as valid as ours. Consider the one you were going to write and then consider ours. Whichever you pick in the end is entirely your decision, and we support it completely.

You have the choice of writing this project within the Codecademy environment to the right or locally on your own computer by downloading the starting code. Feel free to proceed in whichever environment you are most comfortable with.

With all of that said, let’s get started implementing some awesome new functionality!
